Introduction to dictionary

### Aim : Introduction to Dictionary

### Theory :
 A dictionary in Python is a built-in data type used to store data in key–value pairs.

### Key points :

Written using curly braces {}

Each key is unique

Values can be of any data type

Data is unordered (in older Python) but insertion-ordered in modern Python

Data canot be duplicated

### Functions : 

len(dict) : To find out the length of dictionary

dict.values() : To only display the valus in dictionary

type(dict) : To display the class of data

dict.pop : to remove a element from dictionary

marks.get : acts as a subtitute to if else statement in dictionary

### Algorithm : 

## write a python program to search for students marks:

Start

Create a dictionary marks with student names as keys and their marks as values.

1.Prompt the user to enter the name of the student.

2.Read the input and store it in the variable name.

3.Check whether name exists as a key in the dictionary marks.

4.If it exists, retrieve and display the corresponding marks.

5.If it does not exist, display the message "Student not found".

6.Stop

 ## Write a python program to update the price of a given product

1. Start

2.Create a dictionary named products with product names as keys and their prices as values.

3.Display the initial contents of the dictionary.

4.Update the value of the key "pen" in the dictionary to 15.

5.Display the updated contents of the dictionary.

6.Stop

## Write a python to to validate the user login

1.Start

2.Create a dictionary user with usernames as keys and passwords as values.

3.Prompt the user to enter the username.

4.Read and store the username in the variable username.

5.Prompt the user to enter the password.

6.Read and store the password in the variable password.

7.Check whether the password entered matches the password stored for the given username in the dictionary.

8.If they match, display "Login Successful".

9.Otherwise, display "Login Failed".

10.Stop

## write a python to find out the maximum marks

1.Start

2.Create a dictionary marks with student names as keys and their marks as values.

3.Use the max() function with marks.get to find the key (student name) having the highest marks.

4.Store the result in the variable topper.

5.Display the name of the topper.

6.Stop

### Conclusion :
We learnt about dictionary and Codes and functions for dictionary were successfully executed in google colab
